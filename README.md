# What's That Sound? Sci-Fi Sound Effects Quiz
This is my project for Mobile Applications 2. This app is a quiz game in which users test their ability to identify various sci-fi franchises by their sound effects.

# How to Play
Load up the app and press START on the main screen to begin the game. On the game screen, pressing the PLAY SOUND button will play a sound, while the rest of the buttons are the potential answers. If the correct answer is given, the game will progress to the next level and the user's score will increase. If an incorrect answer is given, the game will end with a Game Over button to return to the main menu, saving the score in the process. If the player makes it to the end of the game, they will be prompted with a You Win button to save their score and return to the main menu.
